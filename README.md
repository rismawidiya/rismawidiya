  <a href="https://rismawidiya.github.io" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">Hi, I'm Risma!</a>
</h2>

<p>
I'm an aspiring data scientist who loves turning messy data into clear stories and actionable solutions.
</p>
  
<p>
I didn't start out as a data scientist right away. My background is actually in Geophysics. During my internship back in the university, I got my first real taste of working with data, and that's where my love for it began.
</p>

<p>
Life took me in a few different directions after that. I worked as a freelance writer and later as a customer service specialist. I enjoyed those chapters, too. Writing sharpened my storytelling and working with customers gave me perspective and empathy for different kinds of people.</p>

<p>But deep down, I knew my first love had always been data. So here I am, back full circle; exploring, cleaning, analysing, and building models, while still weaving in my storytelling skills to make insights clear and meaningful for others.</p>

<p>And don't be put off by my eclectic work experience. Apparently, I was put on this earth to clear all the side quests that led me here before unlocking my true main storyline: data science.</p>

<h2 align="left">Projects & Case Studies</h2>

<p>Here are some selected projects showcasing my work in data science, analytics, and visualisation:</p>

<div align="center">

  <!-- Project 1 -->
  <a href="https://github.com/rismawidiya/Module-02-Capstone-Risma" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rismawidiya/Risma/refs/heads/main/images/project1.jpg" width="500" height="420" alt="NYC Taxi Project" />
    <p>Drive Smart, Maximise Profits: Data-Driven Insights to Boost NYC Taxi Company Revenue</p>
  </a>
  <p>I analysed NYC Taxi Trip Data to identify key revenue drivers and strategies for boosting taxi company profits. After cleaning and validating the dataset, I performed exploratory data analysis in Python and built interactive Tableau dashboards to examine patterns by pickup and drop-off zones, time of day, trip length, passenger count, fare type, and trip type. </p>
  <p>The findings highlighted high-demand zones such as East Harlem and Manhattanville, profitable time windows like weekday evenings, and revenue concentration in short, single passenger street-hail trips. Based on these insights, I proposed a driver allocation plan to optimise fleet distribution across zones and time slots, demonstrating how data-driven strategies can improve efficiency, balance resources, and increase profitability.</p>

  <!-- Project 2 -->
  <a href="https://github.com/rismawidiya/Module-03-Capstone-Risma" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rismawidiya/Risma/refs/heads/main/images/project2.jpg" width="500" height="420" alt="Daegu Apartment Project" />
    <p>Daegu Deals: What's the Real Price of Home Apartment?</p>
  </a>
  <p>I built machine learning models to predict apartment prices in Daegu, South Korea. After cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, I benchmarked multiple algorithms, including Ridge, SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting, and XGBoost, using cross-validated MAE, RMSE, R², and MAPE.</p>
  <p>XGBoost achieved the best performance (MAE ₩38,060, RMSE ₩47,530, R² = 0.787, MAPE 18.78%), reducing error by over 55% compared to baseline. To ensure interpretability, I applied SHAP, which revealed size, building age, and hallway type as key price drivers, with subway access and parking also influencing results.</p>

  <!-- Project 3 -->
  <a href="https://github.com/rismawidiya/Final-Project-Olist" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rismawidiya/Risma/refs/heads/main/images/project3.png" width="500" height="420" alt="Olist Project" />
    <p>Breaking Bottlenecks: Delivery Gameplan for Olist</p>
  </a>
  <p>I analysed Olist’s e-commerce order data to diagnose delivery bottlenecks and improve on-time delivery (OTD). I defined OTD as the key metric, benchmarked against the
95% industry standard, and performed EDA to uncover drivers such as order volume, seller performance, geography, product type, and shipping methods.</p>
  <p>To predict late shipments, I trained and validated multiple machine learning models, selecting Random Forest for its strong accuracy and generalisation. The model intercepted 72% of potential delays, lifted OTD to 97.8%, reduced 1-star reviews by 26%, improved average rating from 4.13 to 4.25, and boosted buyer retention by ~6%, demonstrating how predictive analytics can enhance logistics efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>
